Ruby-Cisco
==========
This tool aims to provide transport-flexible functionality, for easy communication 
with Cisco devices. In addition, I would like to provide subclasses to retrieve, 
present and set configuration parameters in an OO fashion.

SSH and Telnet should be working OK at this time.

As I begin here, I know little of the differences between various Cisco 
devices and their configuration parameters. At first, I will be writing a 
class for Catalyst 2900 series switches, since they are something I have
to deal with regularly.

This README will be updated as I move along. This is my first foray into
writing solid, reusable, (and publicly examined) code, so please bear with me. 
Anyone wanting to help is more than welcome - just send me an email or hit 
me up on IRC.
